# Storage and Retrieving Data Project

## Company name: GLAD logistics technology
GLAD is a startup created in 2019 as a logistics service to make a tailor made, faster and less complicated delivery system. Works as an intermediate among delivery  drivers and people based in Portugal that need to receive or deliver any kind of  merchandise and guarantees a delivery in less than 24 hours.
The main platforms that GLAD operate are the website www.gladtech.com or with the app GLAD where the people that need the delivery service and the people that want to work as a driver can apply/use the app for both services and track the merchandise. In this sense GLAD has two costumes.
GLAD has its own delivery fleet that can be cars and bikes and some physical agencies to auxiliate a driver with any problems. In that way when the customer uses the service GLAD can allocate the best and most suitable delivery driver to the customer.
To be part of GLAD driver’s fleet the person needs to download the app named GLAD and select the ‘be a GLAD driver’s option’ and will need to send some information as:
1. Driver’s licence number.
2. Information of transportations: Car or bike.
3. Authorize to share the geolocation.
Within seconds GLAD will perform a validation to authorize the driver to work. In the driver's section he will receive the routes that will be needed to perform, the driver can accept or not the route.

## The product that GLAD offers are:
1. Delivers made from Natural person (physical person):
In this case any person can use the website or app to deliver something to another location within Portugal. The person just to be registered in GLAD platform and when open it needs to input some information as:
I.The pickup address and a responsible.
II.The destination address and a responsible.
